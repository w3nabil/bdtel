# BDTel API

BDTel API is a simple bangladeshi phone number telecom name API that allows you to retrieve the telecom name associated with a phone number.

## INSIDE V1 

I have only 2 different format in this version 1. 
- Simple : Easist to work with . see the examples for more information. [-> ./v1/simple/](./v1/simple/)
Limitations : My simple version doesn't support line number algorithm.  
- Raw : Offers every telecom providers information including Line numbers, VoIP and phone numbers.  [-> ./v1/raw/](./v1/raw/)

## Usage

- [Python](example.py)
- [Java](example.java) (Made with Copilot)
- [Javascript](example.js) 

## Plans for future 

I am planning to have several new versions in future to make it more friendly to use.
